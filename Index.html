    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">To ensure that your website is protected from potential threats. 
        Enable HTTPS to encrypt data that gets transmitted between the server and user's browser. 
        Use unique and hard passwords for all your accounts. Use WAP to help detect attacks with SQL and XSS.
        Limit user privileges to only what is necessary. Assign appropriate permissions to website administrators and users to prevent unauthorized access or modification of sensitive areas.
        Implement security monitoring tools and regularly review website logs for any suspicious activities.
        I Strongly encourage the use of 2FA for website logins, adding an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication, such as a code sent to their mobile device.
        Website security is multi-layered, requiring a combination of measures to defend against attacks. Stay informed about the latest practices and vulnerabilities to adapt and respond effectively.
        Ensure sensitive information like passwords and payment details are encrypted to protect them from unauthorized access.
        
        Remember, security is an ongoing effort to safeguard your online presence and protect your valuable data. </p>
